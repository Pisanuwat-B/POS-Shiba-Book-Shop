# POS-Shiba-Book-Shop

Absolutely basic framework for the POS front-end. Quick and fun project.

## Prerequisites

Windows device with some internet and browser.

## Setting Up

Huh? Set up this project? 
I use CDN on everything in this project so.. I guess we don't have to set up anything. Just use these file.

### [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

I don't have much experience on any JS framework. I use AngularJS just because I found a nice tutorials using it doing similar project. I'm aware that people are using Angular not AngularJS and this thing is slowly dying.

### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

I'm quite familiar with Bootstrap 4.

### [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)

jQuery is here just because Bootstrap want it.
